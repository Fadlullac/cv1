            <h2>What is a CV?</h2>
                <p><i>Experts define a CV in two ways. <br>First, there is a CV that is 
                used in the place of a resume for many jobs based outside of the United States. This type of CV is basically interchangeable with what most professionals in the United States know as a resume. Itâ€™s a one- or two-page document that includes contact information, work experience,
                 education history, and a general summary of your goals. <br>
                An academic CV, however, is very different. This document can be 
                several pages long and serves as an exhaustive list of every educational, 
                academic, institutional, and professional accomplishment of your career.
                Unlike the short resume you may already have, this type of CV is designed as 
                a comprehensive review of your professional life.  </i>  </p>
            <h2>A CV must include:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <li>Personal Statement (Personal Profile)</li>
                <li>Work Experience</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Skills</li>    
            </ol>
            <h3>A CV could also include:</h3>
